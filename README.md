🚀 Excited to share insights into my journey in web development and my projects using React, React Native, Angular, and NodeJS!

🔍 I recently tackled a complex project that involved creating a student record-keeping system. It enabled users to enter student details, manage subjects, and dynamically change their order through drag-and-drop functionality.

📅 Project Duration: 2 months – a great experience as it was part of my self-learning journey!

💡 My Role: I was responsible for developing the frontend and integrating it with the backend. I utilized various libraries like React Router for navigation, Redux for state management, and Axios for API calls.

📚 Technologies Used:

React: For building a responsive user interface.
SCSS: For enhanced styling.
Axios: To handle data interactions with the backend.
This project not only honed my technical skills but also allowed me to explore the intricacies of user experience and data management. Looking forward to connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts and discussing innovative projects! 🌟
